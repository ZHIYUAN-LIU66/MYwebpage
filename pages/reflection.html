                    From this project, I have learned many useful skills on developing a personal website. In my photo gallery, I displayed many pictures which are in different colours.  The final established website, especially the photo gallery, really looks too colourful because these pictures are in different colour system, and I guess visitors cannot focus on what I expect they will focus on. To solve this, I think I should adjust these pictures into the same colour system, or use a lighter background image. </br></br>
                    To establish my website, I completed the HTML files and CSS files simultaneously. However, when I was doing part 3 with creating an alternative CSS page, I realized that I should complete the HTML page first, and then establish CSS file to decorate the content in HTML page. The latter way can ensure a more consistent style for my web design, and it will be more flexible to change the overall style. </br></br>
                    If I realized the importance of interactivity with visitors at the beginning, I would choose to use JavaScript rather than Video. I found the use of video really has limited ability to interact with visitors due to the one-way communication. Neither website nor visitor can receive the response from each other.  If I use JavaScript to add more interactive elements, then visitors can experience more interesting interactions.
